# Airbnb_Dynamic_Price_Engine

Using Python and Power BI, I analyzed historical Airbnb listings data to uncover patterns influencing listing prices. A regression model was developed to predict optimal pricing, and a dynamic dashboard was built to allow users to explore pricing insights. The outcome is a pricing engine that suggests optimal listing prices and a visual dashboard with interactive filters and sliders for data exploration.
